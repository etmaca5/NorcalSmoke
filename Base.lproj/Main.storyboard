4. No Warranties; Disclaimer
a. Limitations
You acknowledge and agree that the aircraft's POH is the authoritative source of the aircraft's information, and must be kept up to date with manufacturers' updates and to reflect any after-market modifications to the aircraft. The Apps and any information provided by or available through the App is for additional reference only and you acknowledge and agree that you will confirm and verify all results obtained by using either of them against the aircraft's POH before operating the aircraft in reliance on or in accordance with any such results, including any “emergency” or similar exigency information or features. The algorithms and parameters in the App are approximations of POH values, and are not warranted to be error free. Parameters and algorithms in the App were derived from a POH that may be different than the POH for the aircraft, and may not reflect the equipment installed on the aircraft. In addition, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible to configure the App to correspond to the aircraft, to the extent such configuration is available. You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for verifying that all parameters and algorithms used are appropriate for the aircraft. The App is not a commercial software product, and has not been thoroughly tested.

b. Inherent Risks
You acknowledge and agree that the operation of an aircraft involves inherent and unpredictable risks of accident, loss, serious bodily injury and/or death, and pain and suffering to you and others, as well as harm or loss to property including the aircraft itself and third party property. You do hereby expressly release all Indemnified Parties from and assume all risk of Harm to yourself and to others that may result from your use of the Ape in connection with the operation of the aircraft.

c. DISLCAIMER

5. Limitation on Liability
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WILL COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL AUTHORS AND CREATORS OF THE APP AND ASSOCIATED INFORMATION AND MATERIALS, BE LIABLE TO YOU HEREUNDER, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MATERIALS OR THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREOF BY YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY, OR ARISING FROM OTHER DEALINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE APP FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, RELIANCE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF USE, LOST PROFIT, LOSS OF DATA, OR DAMAGE TO MOBILE DEVICES, AIRCRAFT OR ANY OTHER PROPERTY, OR ANY DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH.

6. Dispute Resolution
a. Arbitration
Except for the right of either party to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, or other equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm, any dispute as to the interpretation, enforcement, breach, or termination of this EULA will be settled in our individual capacities by binding arbitration in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A. under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “Rules”) by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules. If there is a conflict between the Rules and the terms of this EULA, the terms of this EULA will prevail. Judgment upon the decision or award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You understand and agree that, by entering into this EULA, you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

b. No Class Actions
YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER WITH REGARD TO DISPUTES ARISING HEREUNDER ONLY IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

c. Small Claims
Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than ten thousand U.S. dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. If non-appearance arbitration is elected as provided above, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.

d. Modifications
In the event that Company makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Company's address for notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Company's address for notice, in which case this Agreement and your right to use the App and the Service shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.

e. Enforceability
If this Section 6, or any portion thereof, is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 6 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described elsewhere in Section 6 shall govern any action arising out of or related to this EULA.

7. Privacy
You acknowledge and agree that the information you enter into the App and Service and the information the Company collects will be used as described in the POH Perfomance Privacy Policy.

8. Miscellaneous
This EULA is the entire agreement between you and Company, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, negotiations, or other communications between you and Company, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and, except as expressly provided herein, cannot be modified except in writing signed by both parties. In the event that any provision of this EULA is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then: (a) such provision shall be deemed reformed to the extent strictly necessary to render such provision valid and enforceable, or if not capable of such reformation shall be deemed severed from this EULA; and (b) the validity and enforceability of all of the other provisions hereof, shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby. You may not assign this EULA without the prior written consent of Company, whether expressly or by operation of law, including in connection with a merger or change of control, and any such attempted assignment shall be void and of no effect. Company may assign this EULA without restriction and without any notice to you. Subject to the foregoing, this EULA shall be binding on the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. You acknowledge and understand that if Company is unable to provide the Service as a result of a force majeure event Company will not be in breach of this EULA. A force majeure event means any event beyond the control of Company. The failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, a right, power or remedy provided in this EULA or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that right, power or remedy. Company's waiver of any obligation or breach of this EULA shall not operate as a waiver of any other obligation or subsequent breach of the EULA. The English language version of this EULA shall be the official and controlling version, and any translation provided is solely for convenience.
